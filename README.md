## üëÅÔ∏èOverview

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

### üíÖAdded Features

- **Color Picking for Each Column**: Users can choose custom colors for individual columns, aiding in visual organization and task categorization.

- **Progress Bar Visualization**: Implement progress bars within cards or columns to visually track task completion and project progress.

- **Add/Edit Column Dialog**: Allow users to add new columns or edit existing ones directly from the kanban board interface for enhanced workflow customization.

- **Access Without Login**: Enable basic access to the app's features without requiring users to log in, improving accessibility and user engagement.
